      <div className="black-80 pv2 f6 dt ta " >

      In college, I was attracted to the science of life and the science of a human mind. The combination of which is Neuroscience, the major I ended up choosing. As a person who has always been interested in the inner workings of things whether it be a cell or the human mind, it was no surprise that computers interested me as well. Part time during my undergraduate career I worked at the Arts and Technology Lab, where I learned about editing software, and Information Technology Center trying to get my hands dirty repairing computers.

      After graduating, I took on a role of a research technician at a Virology Lab at Weil Cornell Medical Center where I was able to get hands on bench experience. At the same time, I was offered a position to work at the Apple Store. It was during these two years I realized I wanted to remain involved in both science and technology. I remember working with a graduate student in the lab who had written a program to compare the viral strains we were working with. With this program, we were able to compare the large sequences in a couple of hours. At Apple, I was promoted to a “Genius” and had the opportunity to attend training at their home campus in Cupertino.  During my time there, my interests evolved from troubleshooting hardware to the underlying software. These experiences motivated me to take up programming and combine my two passions.

      I decided to quit my jobs and take a leap of faith and joined Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. The transition was difficult but definitely worth it in the end. It is a satisfying feeling to build a program that can help solve our problems. During my time at Grace Hopper Program, I fell especially in love with machine learning. It is the perfect merger of the two things I enjoy and hope to work in that field one day.

      This was the first program I ever wrote in Ruby!

      After completing my bootcamp, I stayed on as a teaching fellow to help consolidate my knowledge and help others as my fellows had done. Post fellowship, I am self-teaching myself new languages and frameworks to broaden my skill set. When not on the inter-web, you can find me attending meetups and tech events, or trying out a new ice cream shop. I am attempting to find my niche in tech and excited about the journey ahead for me.
